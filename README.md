## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my second solution to this challenge. The previous one I used Flexbox and transforms to move the cards on desktop view. This time I used CSS Grid to position the cards. I also used the grid-template-areas property to make the layout more readable.

I used @font-face to import the fonts. I also used clamp and calc functions for the fonts and for applying spacing.

### Continued development

I have started using @font-face to import fonts. I will continue to use this method in future projects. Importing Googler fonts violates Europe's GDPR.

### Useful resources
